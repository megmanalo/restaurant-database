# Restaurant Database

## Personal Project by Meg Manalo

### Project Description

**WHAT**

This application is meant to function as a working *Point of Sale System*, featuring restaurant-oriented specifications such as:
- food items + prices;
- table capcity; and
- tip percentage (among others)

It would be used to manage customer orders and payment summaries, and log transactions for the restaurant overall.

**WHO**

The user of this system will be the restaurant itself, keeping track of table orders and total bills for final sales. 

**WHY**

As the daughter of two entrepreneurs, I understand the need for an efficient and functioning system for tracking sales. This makes final business computations much more easily outlined and accomplished. Moreover, I acknowledge the fast-paced and oftentimes hectic environments of restaurants that are best managed by systematic organization.

I'd love to be able to work on implementing such a system that can not only keep track of customer orders, but also other details specific to their dining experience to supplement the restaurant's overall business structure.

### User Stories
